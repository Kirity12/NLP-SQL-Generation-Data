The tables station and status are connected using id in station table which is referenced as station_id in status table. 

Question: On which day and in which zip code was the min dew point lower than any day in zip code 94107?
Explanation: List the date and zip code in which min dew point value was less than any day's minimum dew_point. We can fetch these values via a subquery on weather table where we calculate for each record if it is lower then all other records, using MIN() function grouped by date column(aggregate), with that information from there we just have to query another time this same table but filtered by 94107 as required (zipcode).
