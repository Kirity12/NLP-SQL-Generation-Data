The tables musical and actor are connected using Musical_ID in musical table which is referenced as Actor_ID in actor table. 

Question: How many actors are there?
Explanation: This question will require a table to be created with 2 columns as actor and count. First, the distinct actors need to be fetched from musical followed by counting of them in order which is then grouped together using 'groupby' command on actor column for getting final output.
