The tables publication and book are connected using Book_ID.

Question: How many books are there?
Explanation: We need to count the number of books. Since a book can be published multiple times, we cannot directly fetch this information from publication table as it will return wrong result when more than one publisher have published same book with different prices in which case there are two entries for that particular entry but at least only 1 copy is available. So what needs to happen here is calculate how many unique Book_IDâ€™s exist and display the sum using SUM aggregate function
