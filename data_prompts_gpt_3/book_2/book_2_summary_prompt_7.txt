Question: Show writers who have published a book with price more than 4000000.
Explanation: We need to find the writers who have published a book with price more than 4000000. The list of books which are available for sale at higher prices can be fetched from publication table and by joining it on Book_ID, we get all those authors whose books have been published at high cost.
