);

The management table is connected to the department table using Department_ID and head table using head_ID.

Question: List the name, born state and age of the heads of departments ordered by age.
Explanation: We need to fetch the name, born state and age of all heads in ascending order. The values for these can be fetched from head table which when concatenated with management table will give us a result set we desire sorted by age column
