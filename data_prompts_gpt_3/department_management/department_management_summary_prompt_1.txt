Question: What are the names of the heads who are born outside the California state?
Explanation: The names of the heads are fetched from head table and then concatenated with management by using 'head_ID' as a common column. Then only those values will be displayed whose born state is not California which can be found out through WHERE CLAUSE "bornstate" IS NOT NULL AND ("State")="California".
