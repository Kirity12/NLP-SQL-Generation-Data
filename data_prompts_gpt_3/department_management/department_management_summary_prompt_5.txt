"Creation" text,
"Ranking" int,

"Num_Employees" real,
PRIMARY KEY ("Department_ID")
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "head" (

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "management" (

"temporary_acting" text,
PRIMARY KEY ("Department_ID","head_ID"),
FOREIGN KEY ("Department_ID") REFERENCES `department`("Department_ID"),
FOREIGN KEY ("head_ID") REFERENCES `head`("head_ID")
);

The management table is connected to the department table using Department_ID and head table using head_ID.

Question: What are the distinct ages of the heads who are acting?
Explanation: We need to find the distinct age of those heads who are acting. The values can be fetched from head table which when concatenated with management using head_ID will fetch all unique ages in ascending order or descending
