--Using valid SQLite, answer the following questions for the tables provided above.
Easy: How many aircrafts exist in the database?
SELECT count(*) FROM Aircraft

Medium: How many aircrafts have distance between 1000 and 5000?
SELECT count(*) FROM Aircraft WHERE distance BETWEEN 1000 AND 5000

Hard: What is the aircraft name for the flight with number 99
SELECT T2.name FROM Flight AS T1 JOIN Aircraft AS T2 ON T1.aid  =  T2.aid WHERE T1.flno  =  99

Question: Show all flight numbers with aircraft Airbus A340-300.
