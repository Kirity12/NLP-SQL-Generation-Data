--Using valid SQLite, answer the following questions for the tables provided above.
Easy: Show name and distance for all aircrafts.
SELECT name ,  distance FROM Aircraft

Medium: What is the id and name of the aircraft that can cover the maximum distance?
SELECT aid ,  name FROM Aircraft ORDER BY distance DESC LIMIT 1

Hard: Which origin has most number of flights?
SELECT origin FROM Flight GROUP BY origin ORDER BY count(*) DESC LIMIT 1

Question: Show aircraft names and number of flights for each aircraft.
SELECT
